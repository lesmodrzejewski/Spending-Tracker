SPENDING TRACKER allows you to track your expenses. 

A user can:
1. Create and edit merchants, e.g. H&M, Sainsbury's
2. Create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, clothes
3. Assign tags and merchants to a transaction and an amount spent on each transaction.
4. Display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

To fetch a list of transactions, tags and merchants, use the top navigation bar. To edit a single merchant or tag, click on one of the individual items on the list. After clicking on the item, more details will be displayed. Clicking on the edit will show the form, which will allow you to edit the item.

The menu on the left allows adding transactions, tags or merchants.
